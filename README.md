# EBudget

EBudget is a personal finance assistant. It allows the user to create and track their own budget. The application displays this information in an easy to understand PieChart. 
I created this application as a personal project to practice my Java Programming, it also ties into my interest for personal finance. 

I coded this program using Java, and JavaFX was my chosen library for the GUI elements.

Updates I plan on adding in the near future:
- Database to store unique users, account balances, and myBudget information.
- Banking Account API integration to automatically link bank account balance so networth figure updates automatically.
